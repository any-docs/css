**CSS value functions** are statements that invoke special data processing or calculations to return a [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [value](/guides/Values_and_units) for a CSS property. CSS value functions represent more complex [data types](/reference/values/Data_types) and they may take some input arguments to calculate the return value.

## Syntax

```plain
selector {
  property: function([argument]? [, argument]!);
}
```

The value syntax starts with the **name of the function**, followed by a left parenthesis `(`. Next up are the argument(s), and the function is finished off with a closing parenthesis `)`.

Functions can take multiple arguments, which are formatted similarly to CSS property values. Whitespace is allowed, but they are optional inside the parentheses. In some functional notations multiple arguments are separated by commas, while others use spaces.

> [!NOTE]
> The CSS value functions are used as property values and should not be confused with pseudo-classes. The [functional pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Pseudo-classes#functional_pseudo-classes), [linguistic pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Pseudo-classes#linguistic_pseudo-classes), and several [tree-structural pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Pseudo-classes#tree-structural_pseudo-classes) require parameter values, but they're not value functions. The conditional at-rules are also not value functions; the parentheses are used for groupings.

- `minmax()`
  - Defines a size range greater-than or equal-to _min_ and less-than or equal-to _max_.
- `repeat()`
  - Represents a repeated fragment of the track list, allowing a large number of columns or rows that exhibit a recurring pattern.

## Font functions

CSS font functions are used with the `font-variant-alternates` property to control the use of alternate glyphs.

- `styleset()`
  - Enables stylistic alternatives for sets of characters. The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType value `ssXY`, such as `ss02`.
- `character-variant()`
  - Enables specific stylistic alternatives for characters. It is similar to `styleset()`, but doesn't create coherent glyphs for a set of characters; individual characters will have independent and not necessarily coherent styles. The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType value `cvXY`, such as `cv02`.
- `swash()`
  - Enables [swash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swash_%28typography%29) glyphs. The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType values `swsh` and `cswh`, such as `swsh 2` and `cswh 2`.
- `ornaments()`
  - Enables ornaments such as [fleurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_%28typography%29) and other dingbat glyphs. The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType value `ornm`, such as `ornm 2`.
- `annotation()`
  - Enables annotations such as circled digits or inverted characters. The parameter is a font-specific name mapped to a number. It corresponds to the OpenType value `nalt`, such as `nalt 2`.

## Easing functions

The `easing-function` CSS [data type](/reference/values/Data_types) represents a mathematical function. It is used in transition and animation properties:

- `linear()`
  - Easing function that interpolates linearly between its points.
- `cubic-bezier()`
  - Easing function that defines a cubic Bézier curve.
- `steps()`
  - Iteration along a specified number of stops along the transition, displaying each stop for equal lengths of time.

## Animation functions

The following functions are used as a value of different `animation-timeline` properties:

- `scroll()`
  - Sets the `animation-timeline` of an element to an _anonymous scroll progress timeline_.
- `view()`
  - Sets the `animation-timeline` of an element to an _anonymous view progress timeline_.

## Anchor positioning functions

The anchor positioning functions are used when positioning and sizing anchor-positioned elements relative to the location and size of their associated anchor elements.

- `anchor()`
  - Returns a length relative to the position of the edges of an anchor-positioned element's associated anchor element.
- `anchor-size()`
  - Returns a length relative to the size of the associated anchor element.

## Tree counting functions

The following functions return an integer value based on the DOM tree, rather than the flat tree like most CSS values do:

- `sibling-index()`
  - Returns an integer reflecting the position of the selected element among its siblings.
- `sibling-count()`
  - Returns an integer reflecting the total number of siblings, including the selected element.
