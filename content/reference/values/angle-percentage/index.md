The **`<angle-percentage>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/reference/values/Data_types) represents a value that can be either an `angle` or a `percentage`.

Where an `<angle-percentage>` is specified as an allowable type, this means that the percentage resolves to an angle and therefore can be used in a `calc()` expression.

## Syntax
