A [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) **_pseudo-class_** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you select elements based on information that lies outside of the document tree, such as a specific state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class `:hover` can be used to style a button when a user's pointer hovers over it.

```css
/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

A pseudo-class consists of a colon (`:`) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., `:hover`). A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments (e.g., `:dir()`). The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an _anchor element_ (e.g., `button` in case `button:hover`).

Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (`:visited`, for example), the status of its content (like `:checked` on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like `:hover`, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to pseudo-classes, [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Pseudo-elements) can be used to style a _specific part_ of an element.

## Elemental pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes relate to the core identity of elements.

- `:defined`
  - Matches any element that is defined.
- `:heading`
  - Matches any heading element (`<h1>`-`<h6>`).

## Element display state pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes enable the selection of elements based on their display states.

- `:open`
  - Matches an element that can either be open or closed that is currently open.
- `:popover-open`
  - Matches a popover element that is currently in the showing state.
- `:modal`
  - Matches an element that is in a state in which it excludes all interaction with elements outside it until the interaction has been dismissed.
- `:fullscreen`
  - Matches an element that is currently in fullscreen mode.
- `:picture-in-picture`
  - Matches an element that is currently in picture-in-picture mode.

## Input pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes relate to form elements, and enable selecting elements based on HTML attributes and the state that the field is in before and after interaction.

- `:enabled`
  - Represents a user interface element that is in an enabled state.
- `:disabled`
  - Represents a user interface element that is in a disabled state.
- `:read-only`
  - Represents any element that cannot be changed by the user.
- `:read-write`
  - Represents any element that is user-editable.
- `:placeholder-shown`
  - Matches an input element that is displaying placeholder text. For example, it will match the `placeholder` attribute in the {{htmlelement("input")}} and {{htmlelement("textarea")}} elements.
- `:autofill`
  - Matches when an {{htmlelement("input")}} has been autofilled by the browser.
- `:default`
  - Matches one or more UI elements that are the default among a set of elements.

  - Matches UI elements when they are in an indeterminate state.
- `:blank`
  - Matches a user-input element which is empty, containing an empty string or other null input.
- `:valid`
  - Matches an element with valid contents. For example, an input element with the type 'email' that contains a validly formed email address or an empty value if the control is not required.
- `:invalid`
  - Matches an element with invalid contents. For example, an input element with type 'email' with a name entered.
- `:in-range`
  - Applies to elements with range limitations. For example, a slider control when the selected value is in the allowed range.
- `:out-of-range`
  - Applies to elements with range limitations. For example, a slider control when the selected value is outside the allowed range.
- `:required`
  - Matches when a form element is required.
- `:optional`
  - Matches when a form element is optional.
- `:user-valid`
  - Represents an element with correct input, but only when the user has interacted with it.
- `:user-invalid`
  - Represents an element with incorrect input, but only when the user has interacted with it.

## Linguistic pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes reflect the document language and enable the selection of elements based on language or script direction.

- `:dir()`
  - The directionality pseudo-class selects an element based on its directionality as determined by the document language.
- `:lang()`
  - Select an element based on its content language.

## Location pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes relate to links, and to targeted elements within the current document.

- `:any-link`
  - Matches an element if the element would match either `:link` or `:visited`.
- `:link`
  - Matches links that have not yet been visited.
- `:visited`

  - Matches links whose absolute URL is the same as the target URL. For example, anchor links to the same page.
- `:target`
  - Matches the element which is the target of the document URL.
- `:scope`
  - Represents elements that are a reference point for selectors to match against.

> [!NOTE]
> A `:target-within` pseudo-class, to match elements that are or have a descendant which is the target of the document URL, was defined but removed from the specification. Use `:has(:target)` for this purpose.

## Resource state pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes apply to media that is capable of being in a state where it would be described as playing, such as a video.

- `:playing`
  - Represents a playable element that is playing.
- `:paused`

- `:muted`
  - Represents a sound-producing element that is muted.
- `:volume-locked`
  - Represents a sound-producing element that has its volume level locked by the browser.

## Time-dimensional pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes apply when viewing something which has timing, such as a [WebVTT](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) caption track.

- `:current`
  - Represents the element or ancestor of the element that is being displayed.
- `:past`
  - Represents an element that occurs entirely before the `:current` element.
- `:future`
  - Represents an element that occurs entirely after the `:current` element.

## Tree-structural pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes relate to the location of an element within the document tree.

- `:root`
  - Represents an element that is the root of the document. In HTML this is usually the `<html>` element.
- `:empty`
  - Represents an element with no children other than white-space characters.
- `:nth-child()`
  - Uses `An+B` notation to select elements from a list of sibling elements.
- `:nth-last-child()`

## Functional pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes accept a [selector list](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Selector_list) or [forgiving selector list](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Selector_list#forgiving_selector_list) as a parameter.

- `:is()`

- `:active-view-transition-type()`
  - Matches the root element of a document when a specified [view transition](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#concepts_and_usage) is in progress (_active_) and stops matching once the transition has completed.
